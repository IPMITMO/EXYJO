## How to choose a journal for publication?
How to choose a journal: http://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/how-to-choose-a-journal/     
"1. Do I want my work to be published in a general-interest journal, where it can reach a wide readership? Or will publishing in a niche-interest journal be a more effective way for my research to reach the right audience?    
2. Do I want my work to be published in an international journal, or is my research region-specific?    
3. Do I want my work to be published in a high-impact journal, or am I more interested in reaching a specific group of readers?     
4. What’s the journal’s peer-review policy? Am I happy for my work to be reviewed in this way?     
5. What’s the submission process?     
6. Do I want my work to be published in a learned society journal?     
7. Do I want to publish my work open access or in a traditional (subscription) journal?"
